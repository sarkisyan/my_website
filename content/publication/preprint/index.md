abstract: What role do bank deposits play in the international transmission of US monetary policy shocks? Using a panel of US commercial banks, we find that the deposit channel impacts the transmission of monetary shocks through global banks and may account for \$460 billion of new cross-border flows into the US following 1 b.p. monetary shock. Specifically, we document that after a 1 b.p. unexpected increase to the Fed Funds rate, global banks increase deposit spreads by 0.53 b.p. and suffer a 8% decline in deposit growth. As a result, global banks increase net transfers from foreign branches to finance lending. Global banks reduce lending growth by 40 b.p. less than local banks. This corresponds to a 100% increase in the amount of net transfers from foreign branches.
